
ARM memory addresses
physical starts at 0x00000000
peripheral physical addresses range from 0x20000000 to 0x20FFFFFF
peripherals at bus address 0x7Exxxxxx are abailable at physical adresses 0x20xxxxxx
you should place a mem write barrier before the 1st write to a peripheral, if changing from a different peripheral
you should place a mem read barrier after the last read from a peripheral, if changing to a different peripheral
the auxiliary enable register controls the UART and SPI auxiliaries

there is secure state and non-secure state
in secure state, there are two privilege levels: PL0, and PL1
PL0 is privilege level 0, user mode
PL1 is privilege level 1 (system)
PL2 can run in non-secure state, and is Hyp mode

an exception is a condition that alters the normal execution flow
exceptions can be generated in different ways: the direct result of an instruction, such as an invalid instruction, or indirectly because of the state of the system such as an interrupt
exceptions must be taken to a mode with PL1 or higher
there are 7 implemented processor modes, with 2 extra mode extensions
ARM register table in DDI0406C_d_armv7ar_arm.pdf, page #1144
there are 16 registers
CPSR is the current program status register
there is an endianness bit in the CPSR, and it affects memory loading and storing, but not instruction fetches
